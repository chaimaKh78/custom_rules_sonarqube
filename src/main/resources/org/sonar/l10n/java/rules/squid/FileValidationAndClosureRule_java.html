    <h1>File Validation and Closure</h1>
    <p>This rule ensures that files are validated before they are processed and closed afterward.</p>
    <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
    <p>In large file management applications, failing to validate and close files properly can lead to resource leaks and system errors. The "File Validation and Closure" rule acts as a safeguard, ensuring that every file is validated before processing and closed afterward. This helps prevent memory leaks and unexpected errors, thereby ensuring the stability of the system.</p>
    <h2>How to fix issues raised by this rule</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the file is validated using the <code>isValidFile</code> method before any processing.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the file is closed using the <code>close</code> method after processing.</li>
        <li>If using a try-with-resources statement, ensure that the file is declared as a resource.</li>
    </ul>
