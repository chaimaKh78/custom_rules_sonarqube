  <h1>File Upload Security Validation</h1>
  <p>
    This rule ensures that uploaded files are properly validated for their type, size, and content, and that they are scanned for malware 
    before being saved. It promotes secure handling of file uploads to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this rule matters</h2>
  <p>
    File uploads can pose significant security risks if not handled correctly. Validating uploaded files helps mitigate risks 
    such as malicious file uploads, and scanning for malware ensures that harmful files are not processed by the application.
  </p>

  <h2>Compliant Code Example</h2>
  <pre>
<code>
public void uploadFile(File file) {
    if (isValidExcelFile(file) && validateFileSize(file)) {
        // Scanning for malware before saving
        scanForMalware(file);
        save(file);
    }
}
</code>
  </pre>

  <h2>Non-Compliant Code Example</h2>
  <pre>
<code>
public void uploadFile(File file) {
    // No validation or scanning performed before saving
    save(file);
}
</code>
  </pre>

  <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Always validate file uploads to ensure they meet your application's requirements.</li>
    <li>Consider using a library or service for malware scanning to ensure comprehensive protection.</li>
    <li>Log validation failures to monitor and respond to potential security threats.</li>
  </ul>
